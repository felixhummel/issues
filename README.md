## A simple group todo app.

## Features 

* Realtime group updates across ad-hoc clusters.
* Twitter-style @names and #hashtag browsing.

## Running

Right now the easiest way to run this is to clone and deploy the checkout with [CouchApp](http://github.com/couchapp/couchapp).

I'm working on some code to make [sharing CouchApps a breeze](http://github.com/jchris/garden).

You can get help at the [CouchApp mainling list](http://groups.google.com/group/couchapp).

## Contribute

I could use some help making the replies feature more useful. Maybe a mode where users can toggle hashtags on and off and refresh the view, so you can watch multiple channels, but not all of them.

Also, it'd be fun to see different skins for this, like back in the day.

And bugfixes, of course. For development help, I'm on the [#evently](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=evently) hashtag.
